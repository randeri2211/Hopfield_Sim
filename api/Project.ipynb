    "\n",
    "## **1. Goal and Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Goal**  \n",
    "- To design, implement, and analyze a **Hopfield network** that controls a swarm of \\(N\\) robots (all attached beneath a shared object) in **CoppeliaSim**.  \n",
    "- The Hopfield network encodes high-level, discrete **movement modes** (forward, backward, turning, etc.) to ensure the swarm collectively transports the object to target orientations or positions under **delays** or **disturbances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Scope**  \n",
    "- **In Scope**  \n",
    "  - Modeling \\(N\\) mobile robots (differential- or omni-wheel) in CoppeliaSim, each rigidly attached beneath one large platform or object.  \n",
    "  - A centralized or unified **Hopfield network** that outputs which “motion option” the swarm should follow (forward, backward, turn left, turn right, etc.).  \n",
    "  - Analysis of performance under intrinsic delays (actuator or sensor lags) and extrinsic disturbances (uneven friction or small random forces).  \n",
    "  - Data collection (graphs, plots) to evaluate convergence time, positional/orientation accuracy, and robustness to delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out of Scope**  \n",
    "  - Hardware implementation.  \n",
    "  - Dynamic reconfiguration (the adjacency/configuration of the robots under the platform is **fixed** from the start).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Introduction and Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple robots are **physically attached** to a single object, collision avoidance is unnecessary. However, **coordinating motion** becomes critical—one robot attempting to move forward while another moves in the opposite direction can cause mechanical stress or ineffective transport. A **Hopfield network** offers a **recurrent neural approach** to converge on a common “movement option” that satisfies the group’s task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hopfield Network Basics**  \n",
    "   - A **Hopfield network** typically encodes an energy function. It converges to “stable states” that minimize that energy, naturally enforcing constraints (e.g., not choosing conflicting movement modes).\n",
    "2. **Decentralized vs. Centralized**  \n",
    "   - We can implement the Hopfield network as a single “global brain” that determines the swarm’s movement mode. Each robot then sets wheel commands accordingly.  \n",
    "   - Alternatively, each robot could have a local Hopfield module that collectively converges to the same state. However, here we focus on **one** integrated Hopfield network controlling the group’s motion modes, since all robots are rigidly connected anyway.\n",
    "3. **Practical Relevance**  \n",
    "   - Factory or warehouse applications often involve large loads on top of multiple motorized modules. A Hopfield-based approach can unify these modules without complicated hand-tuned logic, offering robust, delay-tolerant control.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Tasks and Subtasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 System Modeling and Setup**\n",
    "1. **Robot-Object Configuration**  \n",
    "   - In CoppeliaSim, place \\(N\\) robots (likely differential-drive) beneath a shared platform.  \n",
    "   - Use **rigid attachments** so that their relative positions are fixed, ensuring no collisions.  \n",
    "2. **Environment**  \n",
    "   - Define friction parameters, sensor placeholders (if needed), and possible environment boundaries for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Hopfield Network Design**\n",
    "1. **Discrete Movement Modes**  \n",
    "   - Define a set of “options”: \\(\\{\\text{Forward}, \\text{Backward}, \\text{Turn Left}, \\text{Turn Right}, \\text{Pivot}, \\ldots\\}\\).  \n",
    "   - These options are **mutually exclusive** (in most cases).  \n",
    "2. **Energy Function**  \n",
    "   - Encode a **desired direction** (the current goal) as a bias that “pulls” the network toward the corresponding movement mode.  \n",
    "   - Enforce **mutual exclusivity** with negative weights between incompatible modes (e.g., Forward vs. Backward).  \n",
    "   - Optionally, allow partial concurrency (e.g., “Forward + slight Turn Left”) by adjusting weights to be less negative, if desired.\n",
    "3. **Handling Delays & Disturbances**  \n",
    "   - Add simulated lags to motor response or sensor feedback.  \n",
    "   - Ensure the network can still converge robustly to one stable mode even if updates arrive with latency or contain noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Behavior Implementation in CoppeliaSim**\n",
    "1. **Control Loop**  \n",
    "   - At each decision step, run the Hopfield network until it stabilizes on a single mode (or combination).  \n",
    "   - Translate the chosen mode into **specific wheel commands** for each of the \\(N\\) robots. For example, “Forward” = leftWheelSpeed = rightWheelSpeed = \\(v\\).  \n",
    "2. **Goal Sequence**  \n",
    "   - Script a sequence of movements (forward for 2 meters, then turn 90 degrees left, etc.) to test how well the Hopfield approach transitions between modes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Data Collection and Analysis**\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**  \n",
    "   - **Orientation & Position Error**: How close the object is to the intended final pose.  \n",
    "   - **Convergence Time**: Number of iterations (or simulation steps) for the Hopfield network to lock onto a single movement mode.  \n",
    "   - **Sensitivity to Delay**: Vary the magnitude of actuator/sensor delays and log success/failure rates or time overhead.  \n",
    "2. **Graphs and Plots**  \n",
    "   - **Hopfield Activation Levels** over time: shows which movement mode is dominating at each update step.  \n",
    "   - **Object Trajectories** in the simulator (2D overhead or 3D views).  \n",
    "   - **Bar/Line Charts** comparing performance under different disturbance levels.\n",

    "## **4. Theory and Mathematical Equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Hopfield Network Overview**\n",
    "A Hopfield network has a set of units (neurons) \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_M\\}\\). In this project, each unit \\(x_i\\) corresponds to one **movement mode**. We define:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "E(\\mathbf{x}) \n",
    "= -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^M \\sum_{j=1}^M w_{ij} \\, x_i \\, x_j \n",
    "\\;+\\; \\sum_{i=1}^M \\theta_i \\, x_i,\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(w_{ij}\\) are the symmetric weights dictating compatibility between modes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).  \n",
    "- \\(\\theta_i\\) is a bias (e.g., from the current goal: if we want to move forward, \\(\\theta_{\\text{forward}}\\) is high).  \n",
    "- \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) can be **binary** (e.g., \\(\\pm1\\)) or continuous (using a sigmoid \\(\\sigma\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing \\(E(\\mathbf{x})\\) leads the network to pick a stable configuration of the \\(\\{x_i\\}\\). Because we have **mutually exclusive** modes, we typically want exactly one unit to be “on” or strongly positive, and the rest “off.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Update Rule**\n",
    "A common Hopfield update is asynchronous:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x_i(t+1) = \\sigma\\!\\biggl(\\sum_{j=1}^M w_{ij} \\, x_j(t) + \\theta_i\\biggr),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\sigma\\) is a sign function (for binary Hopfield) or logistic/tanh (for continuous).  \n",
    "- The network iterates until stability, which means \\(\\forall i,\\; x_i(t+1) \\approx x_i(t)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Translating Mode Selection to Robot Speeds**\n",
    "Once the network converges on a dominant mode \\(k\\),\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x_k \\approx 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_{j \\neq k} \\approx 0,\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "we apply a **pre-mapped** set of wheel velocities for that mode:\n",
    "\n",

    "(\\omega_{r1}, \\omega_{r2}) = \\Psi(O_k, r),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\omega_{r1}, \\omega_{r2}\\) are the left/right wheel speeds for robot \\(r\\).  \n",
    "- \\(\\Psi\\) is a lookup table: e.g., \\(\\Psi(\\text{Forward}, r)\\) = \\((v, v)\\), \\(\\Psi(\\text{Turn Left}, r)\\) = \\((v, -v)\\), etc., possibly with small offsets if the robots are arranged in a particular formation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **5. Expected Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seamless Collective Movement**  \n",
    "   - The object is moved forward, backward, rotated, etc., with all attached robots acting coherently.  \n",
    "   - No physical collisions occur, as they share a single rigid platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness Against Delays**  \n",
    "   - Plots showing that, within reasonable actuator/sensor lag, the Hopfield network still converges to correct movement modes.  \n",
    "   - Possibly identify upper-bound delay thresholds beyond which performance degrades or movement becomes erratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clear Visual Data**  \n",
    "   - **Time-series graphs** of Hopfield neuron activations, illustrating how the network picks each movement mode.  \n",
    "   - **Trajectory plots** showing the object’s path during each movement phase.  \n",
    "   - **Performance charts** comparing time-to-goal or final orientation error under varying disturbance levels.\n",
